        <h2 class="subtitles">Who Are We?</h2>
        <p class="subtitles captions"><em>"In 1918 Giovanni Tacconelli came to Philadelphia from Italy. After a few years working as a laborer, he decided to do what he had done in his native Italy. "Bake Bread". The best and only way, he said, was to bake it in a brick oven. So along with a few of his friends he built his 20' by 20' brick oven. The bread business went well until the outbreak of World War II when all of his sons who had helped him in the business were drafted into military service."</em></p>
